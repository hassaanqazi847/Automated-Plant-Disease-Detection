# 🥔 Potato Disease Detection using CNN

A deep learning project to classify potato plant leaves into **Early Blight**, **Late Blight**, or **Healthy** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Potato is one of the most widely consumed crops, but its yield is heavily affected by diseases like **Early Blight** and **Late Blight**.  
This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to automatically detect potato leaf diseases from images.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Classifies potato leaves into:
  - ✅ Healthy
  - 🌱 Early Blight
  - 🍂 Late Blight
- Built using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Achieves high accuracy on validation data
- Includes **Streamlit web app** for easy predictions

⚙️ Project Workflow

The project follows these main steps:

Data Preprocessing – resize images, normalize pixel values, and split into train/test sets.

Model Training – train a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.

Model Evaluation – assess accuracy, loss, and generate evaluation metrics.

Deployment – provide a simple Streamlit app to make real-time predictions.



🌍 Real-World Applications

This project can be applied in agriculture to help:

Farmers detect potato plant diseases early and reduce crop loss.

Researchers analyze large datasets of plant leaves for disease patterns.

AgriTech companies build mobile or web apps for plant disease detection.
