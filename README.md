# 🥔 Potato Disease Detection using CNN

A deep learning project to classify potato plant leaves into **Early Blight**, **Late Blight**, or **Healthy** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Potato is one of the most widely consumed crops, but its yield is heavily affected by diseases like **Early Blight** and **Late Blight**.  
This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to automatically detect potato leaf diseases from images.

## 🚀 Features
- Classifies potato leaves into:
  - ✅ Healthy
  - 🌱 Early Blight
  - 🍂 Late Blight
- Built using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Achieves high accuracy on validation data
- Includes **Streamlit web app** for easy predictions
